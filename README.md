### **Summary:**

In this project I had to develop a program that, with the use of multi-threading, handles a bunch of Philosophers around a round table that only eat, sleep or think.

#### **Installing and running the project:**
* Clone this repository.

git clone git@github.com:Anesles/42-philosophers.git
```
* Run `make`.
```
make
```
